# new-pro
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/new-pro:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/new-pro:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

# amals steps
# operator-scaling
project for creating a crd that managed a deploymrnt that project is too simple and there is alot pf hard coded things - we can change on it 
refernce for creating the operator 
https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-kubernetes-operator-in-10-minutes-11eec1492d30
steps that need to do to run it : 

other useful refernce 
https://medium.com/@thescott111/autoscaling-kubernetes-custom-resource-using-the-hpa-957d00bb7993


1. run 
```sh 
make manifests
```
2. this is to run the controller
2.1  
```sh 
make install 
```
- can see the crd with that command  kubectl get crds
2.2 
```sh 
make run
```
 - its need to be up on the background 
on other terminal 
3. 
```sh 
kubectl apply -f config/samples  --validate=false
```
to run it in our test need to add the crd to the tnf_config.yaml.
